# D&D Companion
This is my Unit 14 project, a D&amp;D Character creator.

## MoSCoW
MoSCoW is a way of creating a minimum viable product (MVP),
the MVP is what I hope to produce first.


#### Must
- Be able to create a simple 5e character.
- Be able to save that character.
- Be able to load that character at a later date.

#### Should
- Be able to make dice rolls of varying amounts (3d6, d12).

#### Could
- I'll think of things.

#### Won't
- I'm not sure yet.

## Releases
Whenever there is a new release I will put it under the release section of this repository.
